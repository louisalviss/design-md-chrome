# TypeUI DESIGN.md Extractor (Chrome Extension)


## Louis fork: evidence-first extraction (v0.5.0)

This fork adds an evidence-first mode intended for AI app builders and coding agents:

- captures computed styles plus layout geometry, CSS custom properties, viewport data, and readable media queries;
- exports `DESIGN.raw.json` with direct observations separated from derived summaries;
- labels generated guidance as **OBSERVED FROM SOURCE**, **INFERRED — VERIFY**, or **GENERIC GUIDANCE — NOT OBSERVED** so agents do not confuse boilerplate with source truth;
- rejects unresolved `rem`/`em`/CSS-wide keywords instead of misreporting them as pixel values;
- preserves token usage counts;
- adds real-Chromium browser acceptance coverage for typography, motion, layout, CSS variables, breakpoints, provenance, and output validation.

CLI extraction for CI/App Builder:

```bash
npm ci
npx playwright install chromium
npm run extract:url -- --url https://example.com --out design-reference
```

This writes `DESIGN.raw.json`, `DESIGN.md`, `SKILL.md`, `source.png`, and a hash-bearing `run.json`.

Recommended agent flow:

```text
reference URL -> browser extraction -> DESIGN.raw.json + DESIGN.md/SKILL.md
-> agent implementation -> same-viewport screenshot diff -> targeted repair
```

`DESIGN.raw.json` is the source-evidence artifact. `DESIGN.md` and `SKILL.md` are agent-facing summaries and must preserve the evidence labels above.

This Chrome extension extract styles and information from any given site and generates a `DESIGN.md` or `SKILL.md` file that you can use with tools such as Google Stitch, Claude Code, Codex, and others to build websites with a given design system blueprint. The file is based on the open-source [TypeUI DESIGN.md](https://www.typeui.sh/design-md) format.

## Available actions

| Action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Auto-extract | Reads styles from the active tab (typography, colors, spacing, radius, shadows, motion). |
| Generate `DESIGN.md` | Produces design-system documentation markdown from extracted signals. |
| Generate `SKILL.md` | Produces agent-ready skill markdown from extracted signals. |
| Refresh | Re-runs extraction for the current page state. |
| Download | Saves generated output as `DESIGN.md` or `SKILL.md`. |
| Explain (`?`) | Shows how the file was generated, with TypeUI reference. |

## Generated file structure

The generated markdown follows this structure:

| Section | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Mission` | Defines the design-system objective for the extracted site. |
| `Brand` | Captures product/brand context, URL, audience, and product surface. |
| `Style Foundations` | Lists inferred visual tokens and foundations. |
| `Accessibility` | Applies WCAG 2.2 AA requirements and interaction constraints. |
| `Writing Tone` | Sets guidance tone for implementation-ready output. |
| `Rules: Do` | Lists required implementation practices. |
| `Rules: Don't` | Lists anti-patterns and prohibited behavior. |
| `Guideline Authoring Workflow` | Defines ordered guideline authoring steps. |
| `Required Output Structure` | Enforces consistent output sections. |
| `Component Rule Expectations` | Defines required interaction/state details. |
| `Quality Gates` | Adds testable quality and consistency checks. |
